## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jagger Pennell, and I am a second year Computer Science student at Missouri State University. I am just now learning about using github, and I am excited to become proficient at it. My hobbies include singing in a church choir, gaming, and trivia. Additionally, I am a member of Delta Sigma Phi here at Missouri State, where I serve as Academics Chair and Treasurer.

Nice to meet you!
